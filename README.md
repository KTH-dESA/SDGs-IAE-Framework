The 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development is comprised of 17 goals with 169 interlinked targets, including SDG7, which calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services for all. Given the established existence of synergies and trade-offs between the pursuit of SDG7 and the other targets, the SDGs can be used as a lens to help shape holistic energy projects. This tool is part of a study that attempts to develop a framework for a qualitative assessment of SDG target synergies and trade-offs within the context of a given energy project.  It is a starting-point for project developers and investors in an overall sustainability assessment of a project and can be used to direct further in-depth analysis of specific interactions, as well as to suggest areas for collaboration or mitigation to improve the sustainability of the project. 	
	
Please read this sheet in its entirety before using the tool. 	
Modifications to this Workbook outside of the directions below may lead to malfunction. Do not manually unhide or rehide rows. Do not paste into cells with data validation.	
This file is compatible with Microsoft Excel for Windows. This file is largely compatible with Microsoft Excel for Mac Versions 16.16 or later; some functionality such as "More Information" and results sorting is not available.	
	
DIRECTIONS	
	
1	Confirm that macros are enabled for this excel workbook. If not, reopen the workbook and enable macros. 
	
2	Move to the "Questionnaire" tab. Fill in all questions using the drop-down menus. If you are unsure of an answer, use the option "Maybe". If the answer to the question could be both Yes and No, use the option "Yes and No". This will ensure that all possible results are returned. 
	
*	More questions may appear based on your answers. It is recommended, though not necessary, that you answer the questions in order. 
	
*	If possible, avoid using the "Other" selection for project type. If your project is close to one of the specific options available, it is recommended to use that selection.
	
*	For hybrid energy projects, the framework should be filled separately for each component of the project. After that, the results may be combined.
	
*	Questions that use specific terminology include a "More Information" button. Click this button to see a more detailed description of the question, and a link to more information if applicable.
	
3	Press  the "See My Results" button. Two new Sheets will appear with the results of the tool. This may take a few moments. 
	
4	Use the "User Defined Priority" column to set the relevance of each target to your project. 5 indicates the most relevant, while 1 indicates the least. 0 indicates that the target is not relevant at all.
	
5	Press the "Organize Results" button. A new Sheet will appear at the end of the workbook. This sheet displays the targets organized based on the relevance chosen in the previous Sheet. 
	
6	If you would like to change your questionnaire answers after pressing "See My Results", you must press "Reset" to reset the Results sheets. If you would like to change your prioritization after pressing the "Organize Results" button, you must press "Re-Prioritize".
	
DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS	
The "Results_Graphic" sheet gives a graphic representation of the results, organized into the three pillars of sustainability: Economy, Society, Environment.	
	Orange Box: Possible trade-off
	Green Box: Possible synergy 
	
The "Results" sheet gives descriptions of the possible SDG linkages for your project. Descriptions of each column are shown below. 	
	Column A: Target with a linkage to your project.
	Column B: Description of that target, as set forth by the UN.
	Column C: Shows if the linkages is a synergy or a trade-off.
	Column D: Short description of the linkage, as written by the authors. 
	Column E: Section in which the linkage was obtained. 
	Column F: Specific question within that section that produced the linkage. 
	Column G: User-defined priority. Fill in as applicable to your project. 
	
The "Organized_Results" sheet gives the information on the "Results" sheet organized by User-Defined Priority. Note that any targets given a priority of 0 will not appear.
